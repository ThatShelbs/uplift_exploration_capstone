# uplift_exploration_capstone
Capstone focuses on meta-learners and demonstrates an end-to-end uplift algorithm validation framework

## Project Purpose
The project explores cutting-edge uplift modeling techniques. Uplift modeling is a set of data science techniques that leverage both causal inference and machine learning to predict the effect of a treatment. It can be used to understand if a treatment (such as a marketing advertisement) caused the desired outcome (such as a purchase). The end result is typically a scored list of customers to prioritize because they can be persuaded by the intervention.

The project contains both research and application. In result, the project is presented as two components:
1.	An in-depth review of uplift modeling and its applications 
2.	A deep-dive on a special set of uplift methods available in Python called meta-learners
